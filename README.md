### About

A basic online web application for a photographer, to store virtual records of their camera lenses. The user can add, edit and delete camera lenses. The app was created in 2022 during my second year at Haaga-Helia UAS, Helsinki. It was built in Eclipse using Spring Boot and Java. The app is ran in the users webs browser.
